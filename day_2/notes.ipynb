    "## Lists:\n",
    "In Python, a list is a built-in data type used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are created using square brackets [ ].\n",
    "* ``Ordered``: Items have a defined order that wonâ€™t change.\n",
    "* ``Mutable``: You can modify, add, and remove items.\n",
    "* ``Allow duplicates``: Items with the same value are allowed.\n",
    "* ``Indexing``: Use index (starting from 0) to access items.\n",
    "       - Negative indexes count from the end (e.g., mylist[-1] refers to the last item).\n",
    "* Lists can contain different data types (e.g., strings, integers, booleans).\n"

    "\n",
    "Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. In Python, tuples can be created by placing the elements inside parentheses `()`, separated by commas.\n",
    "* Tuple is a collection of objects which are ``ordered`` and ``immutable``(pyhton will raise an error if we try to change the value inside the tuple).\n",
    "* ``Tuples are appropriate for data that remains constant.``\n",
    "* Tuple is ``heterogeneous`` because it can contain elements of different data types, such as numbers, strings or other tuples. \n",
    "* Tuples can allow to contain ``duplicate`` values.\n",
    "* python also allows to create empty tuples using parentheses `( )`.\n",
    "* python provides built-in functions like `len()`, `max()`, `min()` etc., that work on tuples.\n",
    "* Usage: python tuples are used when you need an ordered set of immutable data."

    "* The ``keys are unique`` in the dictionary but ``values can be duplicate``.\n",
    "* We can access the value corresponding to the given key using square brackets [].\n",
    "* ``keys`` : tuple, boolean, int, float, string or variable name.\n",
    "    - Special case charecters(```@,#,$,%```) are not allowed as a key. only tuple can be key but list,set, dict are  not allowed(``unhashable``).\n",
